        <h1>Chemistry</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> Chemistry is the branch of science focused on the properties, structure, composition, and behavior of matter, particularly how substances interact,
            combine, and change through chemical reactions. It explores the nature of atoms, molecules, and ions, and the bonds that hold them together in chemical compounds.
            As a physical science, chemistry studies the transformations substances undergo and the energy involved in those changes, helping us understand the fundamental makeup
            of the physical world.</p>
        <p> Often referred to as the “central science,” chemistry bridges physics and biology and underpins various scientific and practical disciplines. It plays a crucial role
            in fields such as pharmacology, environmental science, geology, forensics, and agriculture. Chemistry has ancient roots and has evolved into numerous specialized areas,
            including organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, and biochemistry. Its principles are applied widely in the chemical industry and other sectors for innovation,
            research, and economic development. </p>
