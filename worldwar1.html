    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> World War I (1914–1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict primarily fought between the Allies and the Central Powers. It was marked by
            trench warfare in Europe, as well as widespread use of machine guns, artillery, poison gas, tanks, and aircraft. The war resulted in around 10 million military deaths,
            20 million wounded, and millions of civilian casualties, including those caused by genocide and the Spanish flu pandemic. </p>
        <p> The war's causes included rising tensions from industrialization, imperial competition, and power shifts due to Germany’s rise and the Ottoman Empire’s decline.
            The immediate spark was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary, leading to declarations of war across Europe. Germany’s early offensive
            failed, leading to a prolonged and deadly stalemate on the Western Front.</p>
        <p>The U.S. joined the Allies in 1917, while Russia exited the war following the Bolshevik Revolution. Germany’s 1918 offensive failed, and the Allies’ Hundred Days Offensive
            forced its retreat. As Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and others surrendered, Germany faced revolution and signed an armistice on November 11, 1918.
            The postwar Treaty of Versailles punished Germany and redrew borders, creating new nations. Though the League of Nations was formed to ensure peace, unresolved tensions
            led to World War II.</p>
