        <p>- Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that uses variables to represent unknown values and explores the conditions under which mathematical
            statements are true. Elementary algebra, taught in schools, focuses on manipulating equations to isolate variables. Linear algebra extends this by solving
            systems of linear equations. Abstract algebra generalizes these concepts to include structures like groups, rings, and fields, defined by sets and operations
            that follow specific rules (axioms). Broader frameworks like universal algebra and category theory study the common patterns among these structures. </p>

        <p>    Historically, algebra began as a tool for solving practical problems, particularly in geometry. Over time, mathematicians developed general methods to solve
            equations and transitioned from verbal descriptions to symbolic notation in the 16th and 17th centuries. By the 19th century, algebra evolved beyond solving equations
            to encompass a wide range of algebraic operations and structures. Today, algebra plays a central role in various mathematical disciplines—including geometry,
            number theory, and calculus—as well as in fields like logic and the sciences.</p>
