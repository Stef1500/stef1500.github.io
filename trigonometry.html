        <p> Trigonometry is a mathematical discipline originating from ancient Greece, focusing on the relationships between angles and side lengths of triangles.
            Its development in the 3rd century BC, spurred by applications in astronomy, led to the study of trigonometric functions which define these relationships
            through ratios of triangle sides. Greek mathematicians initially concentrated on chord calculations, while Indian scholars produced early trigonometric tables. </p>
        <br>
        <p>   Over time, trigonometry found practical applications in fields like geodesy, surveying, celestial mechanics, and navigation due to its ability to model
            and solve geometric problems involving angles and distances. One of its defining features is the set of trigonometric identities, extensively used to simplify
            expressions, transform equations, and solve problems in various contexts. These identities enable mathematicians and scientists to manipulate trigonometric functions
            effectively, making them invaluable in both theoretical and applied mathematics.</p>
