    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms, encompassing a broad range of natural sciences that explore the structure, function,
            growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of life. It centers around five major themes: the cell as the fundamental unit of life, genetic inheritance,
            evolutionary processes, energy use for life functions, and homeostasis. Biologists investigate life at various scales—from molecules and cells to entire
            ecosystems—employing tools like observation, experimentation, and mathematical modeling. Modern biology is rooted in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by
            natural selection and the molecular understanding of DNA, which has revolutionized fields such as medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.</p>
        <p>Life on Earth began over 3.7 billion years ago and now spans a vast diversity of organisms, from single-celled microbes to complex multicellular plants and animals.
            Organisms are classified using taxonomic and phylogenetic systems that reflect shared traits and evolutionary ancestry. These life forms interact in ecosystems,
            playing critical roles in energy flow and nutrient cycling. Biology is a dynamic field that evolves with technological advancements, driving discoveries that address
            global challenges like disease, climate change, and biodiversity loss while deepening our understanding of life itself. </p>
