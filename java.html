        <h1>Java</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> Java is a high-level, object-oriented, memory-safe programming language designed with the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA). This means Java programs,
            once compiled to bytecode, can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making them highly portable. Its syntax is similar to C and C++ but excludes many
            of their low-level programming features. Java also supports dynamic runtime features such as reflection and code modification. Though compiled, it offers some flexibility
            typical of interpreted languages. Java has maintained widespread use due to its reliability, performance, and large ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995, Java quickly rose in popularity. In 2007, Sun relicensed much of Java under the GPL-2.0 license,
            and after Oracle acquired Sun in 2010, it took over Java’s development, including its HotSpot JVM. The open-source OpenJDK now serves as the official
            Java reference implementation. As of March 2025, Java 24 is the most current version, while versions 8, 11, 17, and 21 remain under long-term support.
            Despite its enduring presence, Java’s usage has gradually declined with the rise of alternative JVM-based languages.</p>
