        <h1>C++</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language, first released in 1985. It introduced
            object-oriented programming (OOP) features and has since grown to include functional programming capabilities and powerful tools for low-level memory manipulation.
            C++ is widely used for system software, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. It is typically compiled and supported by major vendors such as Microsoft,
            GNU, LLVM, and Intel. Over the years, the language has gone through multiple standard revisions, with the most recent being C++23, published in October 2024.</p>
        <p>Designed with efficiency and flexibility in mind, C++ remains a popular choice for developing large-scale applications such as operating systems, desktop software,
            games, and servers. Its standardization is overseen by the ISO, and the language has followed a regular three-year update cycle since 2012. Despite its power and broad
            usage, C++ has faced criticism from notable figures in the programming world—including Linus Torvalds and Donald Knuth—due to concerns over complexity and language design.
            Nonetheless, C++ continues to evolve, with the next standard, C++26, currently in development.</p>
