    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> The Cold War (1947–1991) was a prolonged geopolitical rivalry between the United States and its Western allies, representing capitalist democracies,
            and the Soviet Union with its Eastern Bloc allies, promoting communism. Though the two superpowers never fought directly, they engaged in proxy wars, arms races,
            espionage, propaganda, and political maneuvering to expand their global influence. Key flashpoints included the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis.
            The conflict also extended to space and technology through the Space Race, and into economics with competing aid programs like the U.S.'s Marshall Plan and Soviet support
            to developing nations.</p>
        <p>The division of Europe after World War II, symbolized by the Iron Curtain, created distinct spheres of influence. Tensions deepened with the formation of NATO and the
            Warsaw Pact, and each side often intervened in international politics, including regime changes and support for client states. The Cold War saw moments of both
            confrontation and easing, such as détente and arms control treaties. The eventual decline of Soviet power, Gorbachev’s reforms, and the collapse of Eastern European
            communist regimes in 1989 culminated in the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, officially ending the Cold War and reshaping the global political order.</p>
