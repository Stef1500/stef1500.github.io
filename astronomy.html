        <h1>Astronomy</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that occur beyond Earth's atmosphere. It applies principles from physics, mathematics,
            and chemistry to understand the origins, structure, and evolution of bodies such as stars, planets, moons, galaxies, and comets. Astronomy also investigates
            cosmic events like supernovae, pulsars, and gamma-ray bursts, as well as fundamental features of the universe, including cosmic microwave background radiation.
            A key subfield, cosmology, focuses on studying the universe as a wholeâ€”its history, large-scale structure, and eventual fate.</p>
        <p> One of the oldest sciences, astronomy dates back to early civilizations like the Babylonians, Egyptians, Chinese, and Maya, who observed the skies to track
            time and navigate. Modern astronomy is divided into observational and theoretical branches: the former gathers data through telescopes and instruments,
            while the latter uses models and simulations to explain celestial behavior. These two areas work together to expand our understanding of the cosmos. Notably,
            amateur astronomers continue to contribute to the field by observing transient events and discovering new objects, making astronomy one of the few sciences
            where non-professionals play a meaningful role. </p>
