    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>- Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape, and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.
            Originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of infinitesimals", it has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus. </p>
        <br>
        <p>    The former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while the latter concerns
            accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by
            the fundamental theorem of calculus. They make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to
            a well-defined limit. It is the "mathematical backbone" for dealing with problems where variables change with time or another reference variable.</p>
