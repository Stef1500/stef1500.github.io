        <h1>Physics</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> Physics is the scientific study of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces that govern their interactions across space and time. It explores the behavior and motion
            of particles and objects, as well as the structure of the universe from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies. As one of the most foundational sciences,
            physics seeks to uncover the laws of nature that underlie all physical phenomena, and physicists use mathematics and experimentation to develop theories and models that
            describe these principles.</p>
        <p> Historically rooted in natural philosophy, physics evolved into a distinct field during the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century and has continued to influence many
            other sciences and disciplines. Its discoveries have driven major technological innovations, such as electronics, computers, nuclear power, and industrial machinery.
            Physics also intersects with areas like biophysics and quantum chemistry, and continues to shape our understanding of the universe while enabling advancements that impact
            daily life and future scientific research. </p>
