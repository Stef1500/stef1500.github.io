        <h1>American Civil War</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> The American Civil War (1861–1865) was fought between the Union (North)
            and the Confederacy (South), which was formed by Southern states that seceded over the issue
            of slavery’s expansion into western territories. Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860, opposing slavery's spread, prompted seven Southern states to secede
            and later attack Fort Sumter, starting the war. Four more states joined the Confederacy, which controlled about one-third of the U.S. population. </p>
        <p>   Initial battles were inconclusive in the East, but the Union made gains in the West. In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, making the
            abolition of slavery a Union war aim. Key victories like the sieges of Vicksburg and Atlanta, and General Sherman's March to the Sea, weakened the South.
            General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant in April 1865, effectively ending the war. Days later, Lincoln was assassinated.</p>
        <p>The war destroyed much of the South, led to the abolition of slavery, and freed four million enslaved people. Reconstruction followed, aiming to reintegrate
            Southern states and secure rights for former slaves. With an estimated 698,000 military deaths,
            it remains the deadliest conflict in U.S. history and a major subject of historical study and debate.</p>
