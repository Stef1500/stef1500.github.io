        <p> To succeed in calculus, students must be proficient in manipulating algebraic expressions. Precalculus serves as preparation for calculus by introducing key concepts
            like variables, functions, and the transformation of expressions. Leonhard Euler’s 1748 book Introduction in analysis infinitorum was the first formal precalculus text,
            laying foundational ideas in analysis and geometry. Euler introduced transcendental functions using exponentiation and defined logarithms as the inverse of exponential
            functions. He established the natural logarithm using the constant e, derived from Grégoire de Saint-Vincent’s work on hyperbolic logarithms. </p>

        <p>   Euler introduced transcendental functions using exponentiation and defined logarithms as the inverse of exponential functions.
            He identified the natural logarithm by using a special number, later named Euler's number, "e," which is the value for which the natural logarithm equals one.
            This concept is essential for understanding the integration of expressions like x raised to the power of negative one.</p>
