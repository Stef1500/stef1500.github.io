        <h1>World War II</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> World War II (1939–1945) was a global conflict fought between the Allies and the Axis powers, involving nearly every nation and resulting in the deadliest war in human
            history. With over 70 million fatalities—many of them civilians—the war included genocides like the Holocaust, as well as widespread destruction caused by battles,
            bombings, famine, and disease. Sparked by unresolved issues from World War I and the rise of fascism and militarism, the war began when Nazi Germany invaded Poland,
            prompting Britain and France to declare war.</p>
        <p> Germany rapidly expanded its control across Europe, and by 1941 had formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. The conflict expanded further when Japan’s
            attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the war. Major turning points included the Soviet victory at Stalingrad,
            the Allied landings at Normandy, and the Battle of Midway in the Pacific.</p>
        <p>The war ended with Germany's surrender in May 1945 and Japan's in September, after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
            The aftermath reshaped the global order: the United Nations was established to promote peace, while the U.S. and Soviet Union emerged as superpowers,
            beginning the Cold War. Europe’s decline as a dominant force led to decolonization across Africa and Asia, and global efforts turned to rebuilding war-torn economies
            and preventing future large-scale conflict.</p>
